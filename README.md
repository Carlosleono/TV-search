## Context
#
In this project we are going to perform a web scrapping data analysis by using Selenium. 
The objective is to search in Worten web page and get prices, models and technical specifications of numerous TVs and select the one best suites to buy at Black Friday.

## Project organization
#
In this repo, we can find the following:
- A data directory, which includes the images and the dataframes used in this project
- A Notebooks directory, which includes a Jupyter Notebook for getting and organize the data, another for the visualization techniques and a final one that makes the report.
